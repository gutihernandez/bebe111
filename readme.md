latitude - longitude relation is omitted.

Reason: this is because some of the coordinates have minus in front of them. This causes parsing problems. 
Since we are interested in paths or loops we won't be using this 
relation at all because its tails are all literals (coordinates are literals)

relation name:   "concept:latitudelongitude"

Statistics: There are (5508) triples which use relation "concept:latitudelongitude". (Among 122618 triples )
after omiting them there should be 122618 - 5508 = 117110 triples left
